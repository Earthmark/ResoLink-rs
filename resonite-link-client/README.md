# Resonite Link Client

A client for the [resonite-link](https://github.com/Yellow-Dog-Man/ResoniteLink) protocol 

## TODO:

* Member enum needs more type support, a number of types will not serialize correctly. 
* Reduce the number of field edge cases, removing a lot of `Option` wrappers.
* Add failed message support for the client.
